        <h1>(35s) Sport :</h1>
        <h3>We studied sports players like Colin Kaepernick that are fighting against racism and discrimination towards the black community. First, they stopped the game just before the American football match. So they could show the world that black Americans must be recognized for their own value and respected as well, all this while being recorded by lots of cameras to target the biggest audience. This evenement was either well-seen on social medias such as Twitter with the #BlackLivesMatter or criticized by some people like the last President of the United States, Donald Trump. Trump wanted to fire him because it wasn’t related to sport and it was unnecessary to do it here at that moment to him.</h3>

        <h1>(30s) Rap :</h1>
        <h3>The last thing we worked on is about how rap music became popular in the United states. We specially studied on the lyrics of NWA’s songs. For example, the song “Express Yourself” talks about racism they have received from policemen. 
          They are wrongly judged as “gangsters” and accused of smoking and selling weed while they are just living their life as passionate rappers. So they are expressing and writing about their own.</h3>
